# CLI Task Manager

CLI Task Manager is a simple command-line application built in Go to help you manage your tasks. It allows you to track what you need to do, what you're currently working on, and what you've completed. The tasks are stored in a JSON file, making it easy to persist and manage your tasks across sessions.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks to your task list.
- **Update Tasks**: Modify existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from your list.
- **Mark Tasks**: Mark tasks as "in progress" or "done".
- **List Tasks**: View all tasks or filter them by status (done, in progress, or not done).

## Requirements

- Go (Golang) installed on your machine.
- Basic familiarity with the command line.
